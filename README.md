## Inspiration
Atlassian provided JIRA for working professionals to manage their sprints but what about students those who have to manage their work as well as their education to improve productivity. With 'Assignment Planner' our target audience those who are students can have more balance and have more productive days and can meet their assignment deadlines without even managing their sprints. We took the inspiration and thought of dividing assignments into tasks and considering them as sprints where students can have deadline and can progress small tasks rather than thinking of completing the whole assignment. JIRA is right now commonly used in professional industry. By providing this tool students those who are not clear about how to start their assignment questions can then have a plan structure of set of tasks which can be synced with JIRA or Calendar for students to manage their progress. Our solution can have a solution of managing those tasks and progress as well, because it can be a one stop solution to have for them and it can be easily managed by them within the same platform.

## What it does
**Assignment Planner** is a tool to manage your assignments in a planned manner based on your schedule. It will scan the assignment and create tasks and sub tasks for you so that you don't miss any details of the assignment. It does all the work for you, 'You want to go to a party and don't know if you have time or not? Still scared about assignment deadline?', our solution will help you manage your assignment and keep track of if you have some spare time to enjoy your weekend.

## How we built it
We used Open AI for PDF reading and segregating it into tasks. Then we created an interface for students to use to upload their assignment and see their plan of different tasks. We created backend and the UI for user's interface and connected whole system to work for our idea. 

## Challenges we ran into
Challenges were presenting a prototype within the defined time. As the idea is really good and can be helpful in increasing productivity of students, so, it's really difficult to actually 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Achieving a working example for 'Assignment Planner' as it can accept a PDF and segregate it into tiny tasks which can be achievable for students. We as students personally feel that this is going to be an amazing tool as we as students can now work, manage our time without worrying about assignment deadlines.

## What we learned
We learned how AI can help students achieve their assignment deadline and improve their productivity. Knowing how we as software engineers can helps in solving real world problems and we now can solve a big problem that we normally face during our assignments.

## What's next for Assignment Planner
1. Adding study material specifically based on the assignment content.
2. Adding more customisation based on student's availability.
3. Model can be created for defining tasks within exiting Open AI model.
